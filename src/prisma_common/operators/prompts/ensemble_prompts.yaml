  Given the question described as follows: {question}
  Several solutions have been generated to address the given question. They are as follows:
  {solutions}

  Carefully evaluate these solutions and identify the answer that appears most frequently across them. This consistency in answers is crucial for determining the most reliable solution.

  In the "thought" field, provide a detailed explanation of your thought process. In the "solution_letter" field, output only the single letter ID (A, B, C, etc.) corresponding to the most consistent solution. Do not include any additional text or explanation in the "solution_letter" field.

  Given the question described as follows: {question}
  Several solutions have been generated to address the given question. They are as follows:
  {solutions}

  Carefully evaluate these solutions and identify the solution that is more capable of solving the problem compared to other solutions, as this is crucial for problem-solving.

  In the "thought" field, provide a detailed explanation of your thought process. In the "solution_letter" field, output only the single letter ID (A, B, C, etc.) corresponding to the solution. Do not include any additional text or explanation in the "solution_letter" field.
